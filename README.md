##  About Me

[![Top Langs](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=natone14&layout=compact)](https://github.com/natone14/github-readme-stats)


    
My coding journey began in late 2020  with the help of [Career Karma](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjYps30soL0AhXgRjABHfv9CkMQFnoECAYQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcareerkarma.com%2F&usg=AOvVaw2pw-bY3RZP_ZY7sKp_KYIf) I enrolled in the MERN Full-Stack Engineer program @ [Kenzie Academy](https://www.kenzie.academy/) of Southern New-Hampshire University. January â€“ October 2021, opened my eyes to the world of software engineering.  Working with front-end (CSS, SASS, HTML) , to working as a team to plan, build and deploy an application using MongoDB, Express, Node.Js, and React. After graduation I was able to refine my goals down to wanting to contribute to the development of educational software. Such as games for those with learning disabilities. This is a personal mission as I am currently teaching my grandmother to read. While her dyslexia has made this difficult it has made clear to me that there is an additional problem to solve. The definition of the classroom has changed and with it the ability and desire to learn. I know everyone likes games so I will begin here. You will see my work up soon.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building 2D games with phaser & sharpening my back-end skills to be more effective at data-base creation and manipulation.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Java.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything really, i love the chance to learn more.

#### âœ¨Fun Facts: I sing opera, compose music & join love birds together in holy matrimony.
